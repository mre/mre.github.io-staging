When people complain about Wikipedia, it's often hard to say, which part
they complain about. If they are talking about infrastructure and wether
advertisements should be used instead of donations, then they talk about
the Wikipedia, the foundation.
But most of the time, problems arise, with the administrators.

And this was OK. The Tool is really not notable on its own.
I had enough time to intervene, which I did.
You see, nobody wants to hear his work was worthless. That all these
hours you've put in were wasted. You've trusted the administrators for
making the right decision. And that is what it is all about: trust.
