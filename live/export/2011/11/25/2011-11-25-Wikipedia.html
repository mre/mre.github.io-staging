    <p>title: What is Wikipedia
published: false</p>
<hr />
<p>What is Wikipedia
  Wikipedia - The foundation -&gt; Provides infrastructure
  Wikipedia - The community -&gt; Rulesets, administration, maintainers
  Wikipedia - The encyclopedia -&gt; The pure content, plaintext</p>
<p>When people complain about Wikipedia, it's often hard to say, which part
they complain about. If they are talking about infrastructure and wether
advertisements should be used instead of donations, then they talk about
the Wikipedia, the foundation.
But most of the time, problems arise, with the administrators.</p>
<p>Wikipedia Adminstrators are conservative by any account.
One article I've created got deleted.
And it was not about about me. FreeNX</p>
<p>And this was OK. The Tool is really not notable on its own.
I had enough time to intervene, which I did.
You see, nobody wants to hear his work was worthless. That all these
hours you've put in were wasted. You've trusted the administrators for
making the right decision. And that is what it is all about: trust.</p>
<p>We can't properly tell which articles are relevant. We are blind for what we are passionate about...
and we are horrified by the idea, that our work was worthless.
Wikipedia is no promotion platform. But it would be without strict rules.
Look at Deletionpedia. There's a list of Warhammer Weapons with a length of about 100.000 characters that would be right on Wikipedia if it wasn't for strict rules
It sports 35 references. Not bad for a bogus article.

<p>Fork Wikipedia?</p>
<p>No. It's fine. It is exactly what I expect from an encyclopedia.
The definition of relevance in the context of Wikipedia is one of the
best I have ever read. It's well written and sound.</p>
<p>The problem is not the administrators. They are doing a great job.
The problem is  with the infrastructure: An old wiki software where Manual edits are common (sort all artists that were born in 1944 by hand.)
The lack of metadata lead to the creation of bots, which crawl all the
pages and make changes instead of having metadata in the first place.
Metadata which is readily available remains unused
No proper api
People are angry that they can't contribute. There voice is not heard.
  Internal wikipedia pages are a mess
    &gt; It's absolutely retarded that discussion pages are just wikipages where you have to handle comment threading and nesting yourself with indentation syntax.
  Akronyms (AfD) are usedful should be hidden from the masses
  Horrible Markup language
  Search function useless (ok autosuggest but no fuzzy search, use Google instead)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't want to need to spend a bunch at Wikipedia reading countless rules trying to figure that out. The process needs to be simplified.

</blockquote>
<p>But how simple should it be to contribute? How high should the threshold
be to keep all unwanted changes out? How do we keep out the spam?
Two branches
  Wikipedia stable
    Excellent articles, citizations
  Wikipedia unstable
    Missing citizations
    Can contain spam
      Administrators merge the good commits into stable</p>
<p>When I think about it, Wikipedia should be more like a big repository.
More structured like GitHub.
We have different branches for Math and English literature.
One could easily fork an article, make changes to it and commit them.
There would be one official repository.
No human energy gets wasted.
Metadata would get used.
Simple Markdown format.</p>
<p>No work gets lost
  Everybody can have its on forks
  Wikipedia.org would just be yet another view
  You get a solid API for free.
Build trust
  Be more social
    Wikipedia was founded in 2001.
      It was one of the first crowdsourcing projects
      Since then a lot has changed
    "The administrators" sounds like voodoo
      There really is no conspiracy
    Show accomplishments in the style of GitHub
      A picture for every author
        Found out, that it works for donation banner
      "Commits"
    Badges like on StackOverflow
    Twitter
      Verified experts
    Threaded discussions
      Following discussions soon gets confusing
        A lot of parties and opinions and no threads.
      Show a streamlined version of the Wikipedia rules
      Assign tasks to contributors
      Show which changes are made in realtime and have a page where you
      can see, what the admins are doing.
    Upvotes and downvotes for decisions instead of "keep"-Posts</p>
<p>Fork Wikipedia? Yes sure!
Oh! And while you're at it: Fix the search.</p>
